# Project MTDEF-JS

I started Project MTDEF-JS to create my own Javascript Game Engine. My main goal was to learn how javascript worked in canvas and how to optimize javascript. I picked the design pattern entity component system because we just learned it at school.

The plans for the project where
 - File loader (continued to [Project EVE](https://github.com/squeeble-ink/project.eve))
 - ES6 version (current)
 - ES5 version (droped)

Project MTDEF-JS is still open to use for everyone please follow the license.
